# Groovekeeper on the web

The web version of Groovekeeper, in progress. It's an npm workspace; run the commands here, in `web/`,
with Node 24 or later.

```powershell
npm install          # once
npm test             # run the tests
npm run typecheck    # check the types
```

| `packages/core` | Songs, chords, keys, transposing, key detection, Roman numerals, and the `.txt` and ChordPro formats: a TypeScript port of the desktop app's `Models`, `Music` and song file code. No React, no browser APIs |

The core is checked against the cases in [`../shared/fixtures`](../shared/fixtures), which the desktop
app's tests run too, and against the sample songs in `../samples/songs`. When a rule changes in one
app, change the fixture and both test suites show what to update.
